## Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN a user is on Budget App without an internet connection

## Description:

For this homework assignment, I was tasked with creating a budget tracker. I was given starter code and I was tasked with adding functionality to the existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality.
